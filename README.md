[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/docs/technologies/typescript/introduction?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

🚀 If you haven't connected to Nx Cloud yet, [complete your setup here](https://cloud.nx.app/get-started). Get faster builds with remote caching, distributed task execution, and self-healing CI. [See how your workspace can benefit](#nx-cloud).

## Supplier scoring

### Plant Health

Plant Health is the backend score used to summarize whether a supplier is operating well right now. It is calculated in `apps/api/src/app/suppliers/plant-health.util.ts` from five weighted components:

$$
PlantHealth = 0.35 \times complianceBase + 0.10 \times trajectory + 0.25 \times alertBurden + 0.15 \times governance + 0.15 \times peerRelative
$$

Component definitions:

- `complianceBase`: MRSL tier score
	- Level 1 = 30
	- Level 2 = 65
	- Level 3 = 95
- `trajectory`: tier trend score
	- up = 100
	- flat = 60
	- down = 10
- `alertBurden`: open-alert penalty score
	- starts at 100
	- subtracts `severity weight × age factor` for each open alert
	- severity weights: Critical = 40, Major = 25, Minor = 10
	- age factors: under 7 days = 1.0, 7 to 30 days = 1.3, over 30 days = 1.6
- `governance`: AWS certification score
	- Uncertified = 20
	- Core = 60
	- Gold = 85
	- Platinum = 100
- `peerRelative`: Higg performance vs peer average
	- `50 + (higg - higgPeerAvg) × 2`
	- clamped to the 0 to 100 range

Rules applied after the weighted score is computed:

- If the supplier is self-reported, the score is capped at 70.
- If there is an open hard-fail alert, the band is forced to `Critical`.
- Hard-fail conditions are checked in this order:
	- a Critical alert open more than 10 days
	- any open `data_anomaly` alert
	- any open `enforcement_action` alert

Band thresholds:

- 80 or above = `Healthy`
- 60 to 79.9 = `Watch`
- 40 to 59.9 = `At Risk`
- below 40 = `Critical`

The frontend in `apps/web` displays the backend result and breakdown; it does not recompute the authoritative score.

## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx run pkg1:build
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx run <project-name>:<target>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/docs/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/docs/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Nx Cloud

Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Set up CI (non-Github Actions CI)

**Note:** This is only required if your CI provider is not GitHub Actions.

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
